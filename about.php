The Oberlin College Fencing Club (aka the Oberlin College Flaming Blades) is the official fencing team of Oberlin College. It is the oldest chartered club sport of the college, and has been converting young, impressionable students to the glories of fencing since 1929. Our members are of all genders, weapons, and skill levels; many are lettered in the <a href="http://usfencing.org/" target="_blank">USFA</a> ranking system, and even more continue to fence beyond college. Our coach is <a href="http://www.hookedonfencing.org/coach-walt-dragonetti" target="_blank">Walt Dragonetti</a> (part epeeist, part demigod), who also coaches at the nearby <a href="http://www.hookedonfencing.org/" target="_blank">Hooked on Fencing</a>.

<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>The Flaming Blades are a club, so practices are generally more relaxed than they would be for a Varsity team. It is up to each individual how much they want to be involved. Some people stop by for a half-hour if their schedule is open; others come to every practice and are rarely offstrip during those hours. Most of the team falls somewhere in between. More consistent attendance is expected from officers and members of the competitive team.<br>
Our turf is Hales Gymnasium, right next to the Cat in the Cream coffeehouse (<a href="http://new.oberlin.edu/visitor/map.dot" target="_blank">map</a>). We practice three or four times a week, for two or two and a half hours at a time; we get new practice times each semester, but practices are typically in the late afternoon. The practice schedule for the fall 2010 semester has not yet been determined.<br>
Dragonetti comes by at least once a week; on these days he gives one-on-one lessons, answers questions, and tells us to MOVE OUR FEET. We usually have an annual workshop with a coach such as the reknowned <a href="http://www.hookedonfencing.org/coach-brian-stone" target="_blank">Brian Stone</a>.</p>

<h2>Joining</h2>
<p>We welcome fencers of all skill/experience levels, but we <i>do</i> require some amount of experience prior to joining the team. If you have fenced very little or not at all, we recommend taking the <a href="exco.php">beginning fencing ExCo</a> to brush up on the basics and get regain those thighs o' steel before sparring with the team. Otherwise, we take new members at any point during the year; <a href="contact.php">e-mail</a> an officer or stop by practice if you are interested in joining. There is no joining or membership fee. You <i>do</i> need to be on the roster to practice on the team, but it just requires a little bit of paperwork and <s>doesn't hurt a bit</s> stops stinging after the third week or so.</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>We are a fully armed and operational fencing club; if you already have your own fencing equipment, more power to you, but if not, do not despair. Club members are free to use the equipment in the armory, which includes everything needed to fence every weapon, and then some (rainbow feathered boa, anyone?). Equipment repair can be done in the amory, where we have the tools to fix virtually anything; if you need to replace parts of your own equipment, you must purchase the parts yourself.</p>

<h2>Competition</h2>
<p>The Flaming Blades are one of the few club fencing teams who compete at the NCAA level. We go three or four NCAA tournaments per year at schools such as OSU and Notre Dame; all competitions are team, except for one day of individual events at Championships in the spring.<br>
Team events divided by gender and weapon; each team consists of three fencers (additional fencers can serve as alternates). Because of NCAA regulations, it is best to come to tournaments starting at the beginning of the year, since failure to participate in a certain number of competitions can result in being barred from later ones. In addition, people who identify themselves as members of the competitive (NCAA) team are expected to be practice consistently throught the year.<br>
Apart from NCAA competitions, we host a few USFA tournaments each year in Hales Gym. All three weapons are fenced over the course of the day, and Oberlin fencers always put in a good showing. These competitions can grow quite large; epee typically finishes an A1 or A2 event.</p>

<h2>...Flaming...?</h2>
<p> Our name and team colors (rainbow, in case that wasn't apparent) tend to turn heads and invite questions. Our penchant for rainbow is explained by alumna Catie as "...basically a play on the general reputation/stereotype that people in the Cleveland area have about Obies -- i.e., that we're all queer hippies. Basically it represents Oberlin's diversity while at the same time making fun of the stereotype, especially since at the time the patch was adopted there was only one person of alternative sexuality on the team". Our team name, besides being used to strike fear into the hearts of the gods themselves, is a reference to the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorro,_The_Gay_Blade" target="_blank">Zorro, the Gay Blade</a>. Yes, we compete in rainbow socks, and yes, they <i>are</i> incredibly sexy, and yes, you <i>can</i> have a pair of your own as a member of the illustrious Flaming Blades.
