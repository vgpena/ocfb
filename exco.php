<h1>Fencing ExCo</h1>
<p>We teach a beginning fencing class every semester as part of Oberlin's <a href="http://oberlinexco.org/main/" target="_blank">Experimental College</a> program. Here, students learn the basics of modern foil fencing; no previous experience is required and once the semester is over, ExCo students may join the official team. The class meets twice a week, usually runs between 10 and 16 students, and can be taken for 0 or 1 credits. There is a five-dollar equipment fee.</p>
